# Wordpress Backdoor

Hello, this is a wordpress plgin that I created that creates a new admin account on the desiered website. The plugin also will check if the account is still active on the website, so if the account gets deleted or removed from the website for whatever reason, the plugin will make a new account with the same login creditials.

## Default Login
Username: wordpressuserauth
